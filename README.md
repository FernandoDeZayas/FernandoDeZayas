- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FernandoDeZayas
- ðŸ‘€ This github is for storing the projects that I have worked on.
- I do not take credit for all of the work in these projects, as some were collaborative projects for classes. 
- Each project is contained in its own zip archive, or as a text file with a link to where it can be downloaded as a zip archive.
